## Exposes

### Lock 
The current state of this lock is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `LOCK` or `UNLOCK`).
To control this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "LOCK"}` or `{"state": "UNLOCK"}`.
To read the current state of this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
This lock exposes a lock state which can be found in the published state under the `lock_state` property. It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value. The possible values are: `not_fully_locked`, `locked`, `unlocked`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Sound_volume (enum)
Sound volume of the lock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sound_volume` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"sound_volume": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sound_volume": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `silent_mode`, `low_volume`, `high_volume`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `zigbee_unlock`, `lock`, `rfid_unlock`, `keypad_unlock`.

### Auto_relock (binary)
Auto relock after 7 seconds..
Value can be found in the published state on the `auto_relock` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"auto_relock": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` auto_relock is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
